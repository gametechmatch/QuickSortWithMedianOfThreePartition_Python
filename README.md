# QuickSortWithMedianOfThreePartition_Python
# Author: gametechmatch

____________WHAT THE MAIN PROGRAM DOES:____________
The main program (QuickSortClientOne.py) counts the number of value comparisons and copies (values being copied or swapped) done when sorting different arrays
with different approaches (ex: constant values vs random values, changes in the floor-limit for total elements permitted in a median-of-three partitioning)

____________SORTING & PARTITIONING ALGORITHMS USED:____________
This project uses Python to implement a Quicksort with a median-of-three partitioning algorithm and insertion sort for sections of the list (sometimes called an array)
that are less than or equal to a given value (default 3)

____________COMPUTER PROGRAMMING MODEL(S):____________
Object Oriented Programming (primary model)
Procedural Programming (secondary model)

____________FILES:____________
QuickSortClientOne.py --- main program

SortArrayOne.py---parent class to create a list (sometimes called an array)

QuickSort.py---child class to add quicksort functionality
